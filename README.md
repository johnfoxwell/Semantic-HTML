Main topics: HTML, CSS, and Git

# Short description

This project was a good start in understanding the importance of coding optimization and how it impacts SEO. Taking note of using semantic HTML elements in our website so that it becomes more accessable to screenreaders and gives search engines a better understanding of the content on our website. Reducing clutter in our css file by combing elements that use the same styling into one piece of code. While also making comments in our css file for better clarity and to allow for easier changes in the future.

Through the process of refactoring the starter code it become clear to me the importance of these semantic HTML elements as a website can quickly become filed with div elements. While these div elements allow for easy creation and formating they make it difficult for screenreaders, search engines and any future developer that want to make changes to the code.
